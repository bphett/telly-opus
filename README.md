# telly-opus

IPTV proxy for Plex Live TV written in Golang, with ffmpeg audio output in OPUS format
This project is based on tellytv/telly


## This readme refers to version 1.1.0.29 .  It does not apply to versions other than that.

# Configuration

Here's an example configuration file. **You will need to create this file.**  It should be placed in `/etc/telly/telly.config.toml` or `$HOME/.telly/telly.config.toml` or `telly.config.toml` in the directory that telly is running from.

> NOTE "the directory telly is running from" is your CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY.  For example, if telly and its config file file are in `/opt/telly/` and you run telly from your home directory, telly will not find its config file because it will be looking for it in your home directory.  If this makes little sense to you, use one of the other two locations OR cd into the directory where telly is located before running it from the command line.

> ATTENTION Windows users: be sure that there isnâ€™t a hidden extension on the file.  Telly can't read its config file if it's named something like `telly.config.toml.txt`.

# FFMpeg

Telly can buffer the streams to Plex through ffmpeg.  This has the potential for several benefits, but today it primarily:

1. Allows support for stream formats that may cause problems for Plex directly.
2. Eliminates the use of redirects and makes it possible for telly to report exactly why a given stream failed.
3. Makes use of the OPUS audio format

To take advantage of this, ffmpeg must be installed and available in your path.

# Docker

To use telly-opus, use the following docker-compose:
## docker-compose
```
version: "3.8"

services:
  telly:
    build:
      context: https://github.com/bphett/telly-opus.git
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.ffmpeg
    ports:
      - "6077:6077"
    environment:
      - TZ=America/Chicago
    volumes:
      - ${ConfigFolder}:/etc/telly
    env_file:
      - stack.env  
    restart: unless-stopped
```

${ConfigFolder} in your stack.env should be set to wherever you have your M3U and the telly config file. I placed mine on a Windows Share.
